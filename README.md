## Micro frontend container:

- Uses ***module federation plugin*** from webpack to inject the remote app.
- You can add as many remote apps as you like by adding them to the remotes object 
of the ***module federation plugin*** in **/buildTools/webpack.common.js** 
- **/buildTools/constants** contains the production ***URL*** of the remote app.

**_Note:_** Hot reloading is not working well with ***module federation plugin***.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
It will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) automatically in the browser to see your app.

All changes will be injected automatically without reloading the page.<br>

You will see in the console the following:

- All redux store related changes
- Any of the following errors:
  1. Linting errors.
  2. Code format errors (because of [prettier](https://prettier.io/))

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn build:serve`

Serves the app on `http://localhost:8080/` from the `dist` folder to check the production version.

**_Note:_** Use this script only if you ran the build script `yarn build`.

### `yarn analyze-bundle`

It allows you to analyze the bundle size.
